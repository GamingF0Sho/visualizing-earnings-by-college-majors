# Project: Visualizing Earnings by College Majors

### Overview

We'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors.  We will be using Python and Jupyter Notebook along with the Pandas and Matplotlib.pyplot libraries.

**We will be exploring:**

- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
  - Using scatter plots
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
  - Using histograms
- Which category of majors have the most students?
  - Using bar plots
